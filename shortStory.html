<img src="island.jpg" alt="Island">

<p>No man is an island, <br>
    Entire of itself, <br>
    Every man is a piece of the continent, <br>
    A part of the main. <br>
    If a cloud be washed away by the sea, <br>
    Europe is the less. <br>
    As well as if a promontory were. <br>
    As well as if a manor of thy friend’s <br>
    Or of thine own were: <br>
    Any man’s death diminishes me, <br>
    Because I am involved in mankind, <br>
    And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; <br>
    It tolls for thee.</p>
